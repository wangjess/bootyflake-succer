# A Funny Quotes Discord Bot!
Despite this weird name (Bootyflake-Succer), this friendly robot brings good! It emits constant positive impulses (messages) in your Discord server!

Add this robot so that you and your friends will not rage-quit after investing 50 minutes into that grueling League of Legends Summoner Rift's game even though your bot-lane Kalista complained that your Lee Sin jungler wouldn't gank or help at all, and you are one more "noob" message from your feeding mid lane from losing your sanity :D You may be thinking, "Wow, that was oddly specific." _It's okay, my child..._ **shhhh rubs your head**

# Commands
For example, make it emit great dad jokes with the **!dadjoke** command such as...
> Dad died because he couldn't remember his blood type. I will never forget his last words. Be positive.

Need some encouragement to be productive? Easy! Just type in **!encourageme** and it'll give you a nice pick-me-up such as...
> “It is not enough to be busy… The question is: what are we busy about?” ~ Henry David Thoreau

# Bonus Effects

## Forbidden Words
Bootyflake-Succer will also detect if bad words are said in your server and promptly send a scornful message to the bad word-sayer! It will also delete the message that contains the bad word! You can turn this feature off by going into ```bot.js``` and setting ```detectBadWords``` to ```false```.
