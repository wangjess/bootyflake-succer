# A Silly, Fun, Positive Robot!
Despite this weird name (Bootyflake-Succer), this friendly robot brings good! It emits constant positive impulses (messages) in your Discord server! I created this because I use Discord to communicate with my fellow programmer nerd friends, and sometimes we get stressed out. What better way to spice up and brighten an internet chat room than with a funny-named, silly robot that actually has practical use? Feel free to add this code to your own Discord channel!

# Commands
* For example, make it emit great dad jokes with the **!dadjoke** command such as...
> Dad died because he couldn't remember his blood type. I will never forget his last words. Be positive.

You can also change the command prompt and change the API call to use whatever quotes you would like!
<br />

* Need some encouragement to be productive? Easy! Just type in **!encourageme** and it'll give you a nice pick-me-up such as...
> A word of encouragement during a failure is worth more than an hour of praise after success.‚Äù ~ Unknown

Add your own favorite encouragement quotes by adding to ```productivity_quotes.txt```.
<br />

* Want a dosage of randomness? Do **!gif** and you'll get a random Giphy GIF! _Beware, I do not know what you may end up getting. Use at your own risk!_

# Bonus Effects

## Forbidden Words
Bootyflake-Succer will also detect if bad words are said in your server and promptly send a scornful message to the bad word-sayer! You can turn this feature off by going into ```bot.js``` and setting ```detectBadWords``` to ```false```.
