# A Funny Quotes Discord Bot!
Despite this weird name (Bootyflake-Succer), this friendly robot brings good! It emits constant positive impulses (messages) in your Discord server! I created this because I use Discord to communicate with my fellow programmer nerd friends, and sometimes we get stressed out. What better way to spice up and brighten an internet chat room than with a funny-named, silly robot that actually has practical use? Feel free to add this code to your own Discord channel!

# Commands
For example, make it emit great dad jokes with the **!dadjoke** command such as...
> Dad died because he couldn't remember his blood type. I will never forget his last words. Be positive.

You can also change the command prompt and change the API call to use whatever quotes you would like!

Need some encouragement to be productive? Easy! Just type in **!encourageme** and it'll give you a nice pick-me-up such as...
> A word of encouragement during a failure is worth more than an hour of praise after success.‚Äù ~ Unknown

Feel free to add your own favorite encouragement quotes by adding to ```productivity_quotes.txt```.

# Bonus Effects

## Forbidden Words
Bootyflake-Succer will also detect if bad words are said in your server and promptly send a scornful message to the bad word-sayer! It will also delete the message that contains the bad word! You can turn this feature off by going into ```bot.js``` and setting ```detectBadWords``` to ```false```.
